# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use unsupervised learning to process data, cluster, reduce dimensions, and use principal components using PCA. By using these skills, an analysis can be perform for clients who are interested in the cryptocurrency market. This analysis creates a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. The cryptocurrencies were group using a clustering algorithmn and data visualizations were used to share with the board.


## Summary
In this analysis, the data source used was crypto_data.csv

The four steps for this analysis involves the following:
- Preprocessing the data for PCA using Pandas, StandardScaler fit_transform() function
- Reducing Data Dimensions using PCA algorithmn
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-means algorithmn and elbow curve using hvPlot
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies results by using Plotly Express scatter_3d() function and hvplot
